This folder contains the Developer documentation. Developer documentation is meant to describe every aspect of your software of how developers should interface with a given software service or library. When we read documentation, we are learning how the application works or how to use the software's "API".

Arrange your documentation with different sections and depending on the situation, you can optimize your approach to create the docs. These sections can be,

- Getting a general overview
- Learning how to get started
- Language-specific guides
- System architecture
- Application Infrastructure architecture
- API references
- Understand complex syntax definitions

Repo structure under the docs folder can be matched to the sections described above. Navigation can be effectively arranged by creating the folder structure and Markdown files in it as per topic.  However, regardless of the structure of the repository, during publishing the navigation of the pages can be specified in the YAML file which will be used for publishing.

    /getting-started

    /getting-started/README.md

    /getting-started/introduction.md

    /faq

    /faq/faq.md

    /api-references

    /api-references/introduction.md

    /how-to/

    /how-to/update.md

The key to effectively navigating documentation is knowing how good documentation is organized. Developers would love the docs published if they get some of the below information from the developer documentation.

- Class Reference: A comprehensive listing of API functionality.
- Changelog: A reference of what changes in each API version.
- Code Samples: A set of examples showing typical API usage.
- Code Playground: An interactive explorer for trying the API live in the browser.
- Developers Guide: A conversationally written guide to using the API.
- Articles: Tutorials and screencasts discussing different ways of using the API.

The main features of the documentation can also be

- Open source-style documentation
- Interactive documentation
- A Developer blog

Not all documentation includes all of these things, but you can use the above list to get yourself oriented and to evaluate the quality of the documentation you're referencing.
